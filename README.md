# CatPhotoApp Project

This is my CatPhotoApp project, which I created as part of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification. It's a simple webpage dedicated to cats that demonstrates fundamental HTML concepts.

## Project Overview

The CatPhotoApp is a beginner-friendly project that helped me learn the basics of HTML structure and elements. The page includes sections for cat photos, cat lists, and a cat form.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I practiced:
- Creating a proper HTML document structure
- Using headings and paragraphs
- Adding links with the anchor tag
- Including images with proper alt text
- Building ordered and unordered lists
- Creating figures with captions
- Constructing forms with various input types
- Using fieldsets and legends to organize form sections
- Implementing radio buttons and checkboxes
- Adding required attributes to form elements

## Technologies Used

- HTML5

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - The main HTML document containing all the page content

## Features

The webpage includes:
- A gallery section with cat photos
- Lists of things cats love and hate
- A user-friendly form to submit cat information
- Proper semantic HTML structure

This was one of my first projects in web development, which gave me a solid foundation in HTML basics and introduced me to creating structured web content.
